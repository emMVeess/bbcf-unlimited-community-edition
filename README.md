Original Mod by Baroque, modified with the creator's permission.

### Installation

  1. Locate your Blazblue Centralfiction folder.  The easiest way to do this is to go to Steam, go to your library, right click Blazblue Centralfiction in your library listing, go to Manage, and click on Browse Local Files.

  2. In your Blazblue Centralfiction folder, locate the folder containing all files relating to characters.  This is found in BlazBlue Centralfiction\data\Char.

  3. Take all files in the Char folder and place them somewhere safe, where you won’t lose them.  This is to make sure you don’t need to reinstall the entire game to uninstall the mod.

  4. Take all files included in this download (this PDF can, but doesn’t need to go in) and drop them into the Char folder, overwriting any files currently in the folder.
     
  5. Launch BBCF, and test if the files were installed correctly.  Easiest way to do this is just to go into Training Mode, select Ragna as either player 1 or 2, get into the game, and see if Ragna has an aura around him.

### Uninstallation
Take the files you moved in step 3 and drop them back into the Char folder, overwriting the modded scripts.
